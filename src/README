Warning to TCC DPMG ddf developers!

If you're requested to add new AVPs or ddf files, you MUST make 
the change in the main src/ directory and also in the obsolete/ 
directory as well in order to maintain temporary backward compatibility.

This is needed because the Application Names differ in the ddf files and 
so AVP names and constants will differ also in the generated ttcn file.

- 2010.06.29 note by ethecs: this README is updated. The obsolate
  directory does not need to be updated according to ethgasz.
